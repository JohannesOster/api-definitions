    [FramePay](https://docs.rebilly.com/docs/developer-docs/framepay/)
    is the recommended way to
    create a payment token because it minimizes
    PCI DSS compliance.  Once a payment token
    is created, it can only be used once.

    A payment token expires upon first use
    or within 30 minutes of the token creation
    (whichever comes first).
